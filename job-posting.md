# Job Posting

Here's the complete list of details we like to see in a job post: 

- A brief description of your company, and the title/role of the job.
- Distributed friendliness: Permanently distributed, just pandemic-distributed, in-office or blend.
- Location and timezone expectations: US-only? West Coast preferred? Some other arrangement?
- Your (the job poster) relation to this position: Are you the hiring manager? The recruiter? Or someone else?
- Does your company provide Visa sponsorship?
- Salary range for this role: this is now a legal requirement for job posting in parts of the US.
- Are you OK being contacted by contracting agencies?
