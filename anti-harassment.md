# SiRA Anti-harassment Policy

## Introduction

The Society of Information Risk Analysts is dedicated to providing a harassment-free membership and conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of members or conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any professional venue, including channels, chat, or talks. Members and conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the organization or conference, without a refund, at the discretion of the SiRA Board.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body-size, race, age, or religion.
- Sexual images in a public space.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Harassing photography or recording.
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events.
- Inappropriate physical contact
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the listed behaviors.

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. SiRA mailing lists, membership Slack, exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Sponsors, vendors, staff and volunteers should not display or use sexualized images, activities, costumes or other materials.

Event organizers and the SiRA Board may take action to redress anything designed to disrupt the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. If a participant engages in harassing behaviors, event organizers and SiRA Board retain the right to take actions to keep the membertship spaces and event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning offenders or expulsion from the organzation and/or conference with no refund.
