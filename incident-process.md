# The SiRA Membership Incident Process

Our brief governing philosophy:

**Please strive to resolve a non-heinous situation by yourself; if it’s a heinous situation, please contact an Admin immediately.**

## Something is Off

A significant part of the Administrator job is the management of incidents on the SiRA Membership Slack (“SiRA Slack”), but ideally the community (that’s you) has both the tools and the desire to resolve many situations without Admin support.

The Rands Code of Conduct (“CoC”) exists to give members a model idea of what is and isn’t acceptable in SiRA Slack including behavior, marketing activity, and etiquette. If you experience strange behavior in a channel and are wondering if it’s acceptable, please first consult the CoC.

With CoC clarity in hand, please contact the member(s) and explain:

1. This is the activity I saw which I have an issue with,
2. It’s not allowed by the CoC, and,
3. Let’s figure out how to resolve it. 

In any other Slack or community, the default first step is to contact an Administrator, but as this is a Risk analysis community we ask in non-heinous cases to start with member-driven resolution. If you are not comfortable with this approach, go ahead and jump to “It’s Admin O’Clock”.

Ideally, the above discussion can help resolve the situation. It often does. If does not, if you are not comfortable contacting the member(s), or if this is an obvious heinous situation, jump to “ It’s Admin O’Clock”.

## It’s Admin O’Clock

Administrators can be contacted directly, via the @slack-admins group, or in the #coc channel. Please choose the path most comfortable for you. 

When you contact an Administrator(s), provide the following:

1. The activity you saw that you have an issue with,
2. If applicable, the CoC violation.

Things to know:

- The Administrators are committed to a first response within 24 hours. Usually faster. If you directly contact a single Admin, it could be longer due to time zone differences and work schedules. 
- #coc contains all the of the Administrators and is private. If you're filing a formal incident, we suggest directly contacting an Admin at @slack-admins or directly, as formal incidents are confidential to the admins.

Once you’ve contacted an Administrator, they’ll help you triage the incident.

## Formal Incident Process

In the case of a formal incident being reported, there are two possible resolution paths:

1. Raising a concern to the Administrator to give them context, or,
2. Filing a formal complaint that will result in Administrative action.

In both cases, the reporter needs to provide the following information to the Administrator:

1. What’s the nature of the incident or Code of Conduct violation?
2. Who is involved in this incident?
3. What material supports this situation?
4. Any privacy concerns? (Reporter consent is required before sharing any information regarding the incident)

With this information in hand, the Administrator will: 

1. Work to determine whether this is a raised concern or a formal complaint with the reporter. In the case of a raised concern, the understanding is there may be no action other than administrative awareness.
2. Ask clarifying questions of the reporter because every incident is different.
3. Work with publicly available content to confirm the report.
4. Talk with their fellow administrators to gather perspective.
5. The Administrator may deem it necessary to talk to the accused member(s) to gather additional perspective.

With this information in hand, the Administrator will determine a consequence. Consequences include but are not limited to:

1. A Strike
    - SiRA Slack operates on a three strike system whereby non-suspending CoC violations can result in one or more strikes. Administrators will use their judgement and historical precedent in determining what constitutes a strike. When a member receives three strikes, they will be suspended from SiRA Slack for a period of time or permanently depending on the violation. Multiple strikes can be assessed depending on the violation. 
    - We do not have a definition of what does and does not constitute a strike. However, as of November 2019, we are keeping a record of all administrative activity to help calibrate strikes.
2. Do Not Contact
    - A member may not contact (in any fashion, messages or emoji) either publicly or privately one more other members of the Slack for a predetermined period of time. 
3. Temporary suspension
    - A member is suspended from SiRA Slack for a predetermined period of time.
4. Permanent suspension
    - A member is permanently banned from SiRA Slack

For any type of suspension, the admins will conduct a private vote based on the incident. Majority wins. In the event of a tie due to abstention, the President will cast the deciding vote.

With the defined incident and consequence in hand, the Administrator will present the following to the accused member: 

- This is what occurred.
- This incident is confidential. 
- This is how I confirmed what occurred.
- This is what I decided in terms of consequence. In the case of a non-ban action, explain the terms of Do Not Contact, Strikes, Etc. 
  - For strikes, members will be alerted to the strike policy and the number of current strikes they have.
  - For Do Not Contact, members will receive the time period when they can not contact other member(s)
  - For Temporary Suspension, members will receive the time period when they can not be a part of SiRA Slack.
  - For Permanent Suspension, members will receive the content above and then permanent removed from SiRA Slack.

The Administrators are committed to resolve incidents **within five working days**.
