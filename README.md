# SiRA Code of Conduct, SiRAcon Conference, and Membership Slack Documentation and Resources

The Society of Information Risk Analysts is a risk analysis community that lives in mailing lists, Slack, and in-person events like SiRAcon. These documents are applicable to all SiRA activities, regardless of whether phrasign specifies an event, the SiRA Slack, a mailing list, a SiRA Webinar, or any other SiRA-associated or SiRA-sponsored activity.

This repository collects documents and resources for the membership of the SiRA Membership Slack, SiRAcon, SiRAwebinars, SiRA mailing lists, and all other SiRA activity.
